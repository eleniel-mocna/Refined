This is an assortment of different Metacentrum qsub scripts. It contains a good setup for each step,
but these scripts are not created for reproducibility purposes, instead, they just get the stuff done.
They can be a good first step for debugging, but might have some issues in them. I'm leaving them here as breadcrumbs,
for when someone will try to run this code in some time and this might be a good first step.
