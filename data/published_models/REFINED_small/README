These are metrics for a REFINED model, but with a smaller CNN with the following hyperparameters:
```
best_params = {"initial_size": 64,
               "growth_factor": 0.5,
               "last_dense": 16,
               "cnn_layers": 2,
               "cnn_stride": 3,
               "kernel_size": 5,
               "learning_rate": 0.0005,
               }
```
